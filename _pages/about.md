Hi, Iâ€™m Jadesola Kareem â€” a machine learning enthusiast and early-career researcher with a background in computer engineering and a master's in Advanced Computer Science from the University of Chester.

My work focuses on the intersection of audio, emotion, and machine learning. For my dissertation, I built a real-time system that classifies emotions in sung audio using CNN and LSTM models. I presented this work at the BCS Lovelace Colloquium 2025, where I shared insights on affective computing and human-centered AI.

Beyond research, I care deeply about community building. As the former Community Manager at the Freelance Coalition for Developing Countries, I led global initiatives to support BIPOC freelancers, published industry insights, and organized events that foster connection and growth.

Iâ€™m passionate about making AI more accessible and meaningful, especially in areas that amplify creative expression, emotional intelligence, and social impact.

If youâ€™d like to collaborate, talk research, or just connect â€” feel free to reach out.
