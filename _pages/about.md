Hi, I’m Jadesola Kareem 🙋🏿‍♀️

I am a machine learning enthusiast and early-career researcher with a background in computer engineering and a master's in Advanced Computer Science from the University of Chester.

My work focuses on the intersection of audio, emotion, and machine learning. For my dissertation, I built a real-time system that classifies emotions in sung audio using CNN and LSTM models. I presented this work at the BCS Lovelace Colloquium 2025, where I shared insights on affective computing and human-centered AI.

Beyond research, I care deeply about community building. As the former Community Manager at the Freelance Coalition for Developing Countries, I led global initiatives to support BIPOC freelancers, published industry insights, and organized events that foster connection and growth.

I’m passionate about making AI more accessible and meaningful, especially in areas that amplify creative expression, emotional intelligence, and social impact.

If you’d like to collaborate, talk research, or just connect, feel free to reach out.
